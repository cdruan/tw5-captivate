# Captivate

This is a TiddlyWiki theme that provides another clean and functional layout.

## Additional Features

* Personalize the colors of your wiki with just a few clicks. Pick any three colors and receive three palette variations: light, dark, and tan themed. No more painstakingly adjust and test contrast ratios for different elements of the wiki.
* Incorporates TiddlyWiki's layout switching mechanism. At a minimum, you can switch between the Captivate layout and the default TiddlyWiki layout by pressing <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>-<kbd>Shift</kbd>-<kbd>L</kbd>.
* Supports display-p3 color values in palette entries and gracefully falls back to sRGB for browsers that do not support this color space.
